# This is a Mailpile plugin manifest, describing the `demos` plugin.
#
# This file describes the resources associated with this plugin and how
# they are meant to interact with the rest of the Mailpile application.
#
# NOTE: The Mailpile plugin manifest format is JSON, with the optional
#       extension that comments are allowed.  Comments must be on lines of
#       their own and begin with a '#' character optionally preceded by
#       some whitespace.  No other comment styles are supported.
