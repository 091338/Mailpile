    Thank you for testing Mailpile! Have you found a bug?
  </p>

  <h4>Warning: Men at work!</h4>
  <p>
    This is a development verson of Mailpile! You are running code which is
    being actively developed and many things are <b>expected</b> to be broken.
  </p>
  <p>
    So for now, we don't particularly recommend filing
    <a target=_blank href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues">issues
    on Github</a>, except for long-term ideas, discussions or feature requests.
    Pull requests on the other hand, are <i>always</i> welcome! ;-)
  </p>
  <p>
    We don't mean to be ungrateful. Quite the opposite, writing a good bug
    report is a lot of work and we really don't want you to waste your time.
    While so many things are broken, the only way for you to know whether a
    bug is worth filing, is to <i>talk to us</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So please,
    <a target=_blank href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23mailpile">hop
    on to #mailpile on Freenode</a> and have a chat!
  </p>
  <p>
    Obviously, this will all change
    <a target=_blank href="https://www.mailpile.is/roadmap/">once development
    slows down</a> for the next release. But for now: IRC before Issues.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks!
  </p>
