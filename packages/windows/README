# Executive summary

The script `repackage-linux.sh` can rebuild the Mailpile installer for
Windows.  Run it, yay!

... or read on to learn about bits and pieces.


## Building the environment

The environment is currently a hodge-podge of things.  This will become
more polished and move towards a proper build setup over time.

Currently we are pulling binaries from the following locations:

   - http://www.python.org/
   - http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
   - https://www.mailpile.is/files/build/

The files on www.mailpile.is either come from the other sources, or have
been built by us using PIP under Windows.


## The NSIS installer

In order for the NSIS installer script to work, you need to add three things
to this directory (the above step will take care of this for you):

  - A folder called GnuPG, containing a standalone Windows build of
    GnuPG >= 2.0.25.
  - A folder called OpenSSL, containing a standalone Windows build of
    OpenSSL >= 1.0.1h.
  - A folder called Python27, containing a standalone Windows build of
    Python >= 2.7.6 - including all the python modules Mailpile depends on.

On top of that, you need to install NSIS (Nullsoft Installer System).

Then run `makensis mailpile.nsi`.
