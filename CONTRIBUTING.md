## How to contribute to Mailpile

First of all: Thank you! :heart:

#### Code of Conduct

Second of all, please adhere to our Code of Conduct when you participate
in our community. Be kind, be respectful.

[The full Code of Conduct can be found here](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


#### License

Thirdly, please be sure you are comfortable with [our license](COPYING.md)
before contributing any code to Mailpile.


#### Developer FAQ

Does Mailpile seem a bit strange? Are you unsure of whether something is a
bug or a feature? [Our developer FAQ might have answers](DEV_FAQ.md).

Please read it before filing issues or starting major development work.


#### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub
  under [Issues](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
  [open a new one](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/new). Be
  sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant
  information as possible.

* Remember, we cannot read your mind or see your screen, so you'll
  probably need to answer all of these:

   1. What were you doing?
   2. What did you expect would happen?
   3. What actually happened?
   4. Operating system? GnuPG version? Mailpile version?

* Reproducability is key. If you cannot reliably trigger the bug or
  cannot describe how to do so, then unfortunately it's less likely that
  the Mailpile team will be able to do anything about it. It may still
  be useful to file a report in case others are having the same issue, but
  bugs that can be reproduced will in general get fixed much faster!


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.
  Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Do you plan write a patch that adds a feature?**

* Please be sure you have read the [Developer FAQ](DEV_FAQ.md) to ensure
  your feature is compatible with our high-level goals and design decisions.

* If you are unsure or would like some guidance, join the #mailpile
  channel on IRC and discuss your plans there.

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes what your feature does.
  Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the
stability, functionality, or testability of Mailpile will generally not be
accepted.

All patches to Mailpile are reviewed by a human and our resources (time,
people) are very limited. Cosmetic patches are no easier to review than other
patches and we would rather focus our efforts on functional improvements to the
software.


#### **Do you want to translate Mailpile to your language?**

Please feel free to join our translation community
[on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/otf/mailpile/).


#### **Do you plan to write documentation?**

* Please feel free to contribute documentation to
  [our wiki](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/wiki).

* If you would like some guidance, join the #mailpile channel on IRC or
  file an issue with your questions.

* If you added a new page or made major major changes to an existing page,
  please file [a new issue requesting a review](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/new)
  when you are done. Be sure to include a link to the wiki page!
